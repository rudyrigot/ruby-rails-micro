## Meta-micro, Ruby on Rails example based on prismic.io

This is a example project made by the prismic.io team as a showcase to help developers get started. By default, it consumes the content repository available at [https://micro.prismic.io/api](https://micro.prismic.io/api).

### Get started

This project gets started and installed exactly like the Rails starter project, you will find all information [in its README file](https://github.com/prismicio/ruby-rails-starter).

#### Connect it to your own Meta-micro repository

First, create your own WorldChanger content repository if you haven't: from your [prismic.io dashboard](https://prismic.io/dashboard/), click on the "Fork it now!" button in the "Fork the Meta-micro repository" frame.

Then, configure the project as described in the "Configure" paragraph of [the starter project's README file](https://github.com/prismicio/ruby-rails-starter).

Now, you can change content in your Meta-micro repository, and it will reflect in your local project.
